*   General information about testing 

Each registrar is assigned two test accounts when the registrar agreement is signed. These accounts must be created before any testing is possible.

If you are testing your own proprietary systems, you must use [Norid’s technical documentation](about:/en/integrere-mot-norid/epp/#Technical-documentation) as your basis.

### About contacts and subscriber identities

*   Contacts for organizations must be registered with real names and organization numbers from the [Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities](https://www.brreg.no/en/). Pick any organization with an [accepted organization form](https://www.norid.no/en/om-domenenavn/regelverk-for-no/vedlegg-e/), such as AS, DA or sole proprietorship (ENK).
*   The contact for a private individual must be one of a [set of defined test persons](https://teknisk.norid.no/en/integrere-mot-norid/test-system/testpersoner/).

All test data registered is saved in a separate test database. The data is stored for a certain period of time, giving registrars a chance to build a set of test objects. Periodically, we clean up the test database and delete the data stored there.
